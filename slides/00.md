# Partner Exercise: Warm-up Exercise

Once everyone joins, we're going to use breakout into groups of 2-3 where you'll work through a warm-up exercise together.

We'll use Zoom breakout rooms.

Please head to `/exercises/exercise_00` and start working on this exercise with your group for the next 10 minutes, then we'll start the workshop.
